# ChatBot
This project is a chatbot for FGF Brands. The goal is for it to help users to run various tasks like general questions, showing sales, typical conversation, or employee/ company information. It uses a feed-forward neural network made with PyTorch to have a contextual conversation.

### Approach:
1. NLP Processing (stemming, tokenization, create bag of words to reference to)
2. Create the training data / file for the model
3. Feed Forward Neural Network with CrossEntropyLoss
4. Using saved, trained model, implement the chat

##Final Result:
